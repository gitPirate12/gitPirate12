# About
Wannabe web developer currently learning Angular, Ionic, and PHP (yes, the backend everyone loves to hate). Figuring out how to build full apps one bug at a time. Frontend, backend â€” I break it all equally before I make it work. Learning fast, Googling faster.

Check my repos for chaotic brilliance (or don't, my learning curve is embarrassing).
