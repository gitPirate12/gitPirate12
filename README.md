# About

Multi-disciplinary disrupter navigating the liminal space between 'unpaid intern' and 'accidentally senior engineer.' My expertise lies in abstracting away reality through strategic jargon deployment and LinkedIn engagement farming. Currently pioneering the field of hopeful-application-driven development (HADD), where every cover letter is a cry for help wrapped in corporate lingo. Let’s synergize!

# Currently Learning

-Industrial confusion & inconviencience engineering
-Force push and pray
-Escaping jobofobia and nailing that first interview (send help).
-Next.js and overcoming the lingering vibe-coding mind virus, while speedrunning a full-blown existential crisis. 
-Analytical analysis
-Trump’s tariff game (Trump’s tariff game> Sun Tzu’s Art of War). Multi-polar world, baby.  
-Actively recalibrating my endogenous circadian pacemaker to synchronize with socially acceptable hours.
-Rats (those lil cheese eating gray guys)

Check my repos for chaotic brilliance (or don't, my learning curve is embarrassing). Let’s build something stupidly awesome.
