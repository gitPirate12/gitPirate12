# About

Multi-disciplinary disrupter navigating the liminal space between 'unpaid intern' and 'accidentally senior engineer.' My expertise lies in abstracting away reality through strategic jargon deployment and LinkedIn engagement farming. Currently pioneering the field of hopeful-application-driven development (HADD), where every cover letter is a cry for help wrapped in corporate lingo. Let’s synergize!

# Currently Learning
Boldly mastering AngularJS — because why not start with the JavaScript framework that even Google ghosted. Combine that with PHP, the language that powers half the internet and all of its regrets.

Together, it's like building the frontend of 2013 and the backend of 2005, today. Who needs consistency when you have chaos and curly braces?






Check my repos for chaotic brilliance (or don't, my learning curve is embarrassing). Let’s build something stupidly awesome.
