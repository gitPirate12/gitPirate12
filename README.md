# About

Multi-disciplinary disrupter navigating the liminal space between 'unpaid intern' and 'accidentally senior engineer.' My expertise lies in abstracting away reality through strategic jargon deployment and LinkedIn engagement farming. Currently pioneering the field of hopeful-application-driven development (HADD), where every cover letter is a cry for help wrapped in corporate lingo. Let’s synergize!

# Experience

**Vice President of Ephemeral Systems Orchestration & Quantum-Grade Hype Propagation**  
Specializing in recursive innovation loops and postmodern technical debt evangelism.

**Former:**  
- **Chief Ambiguity Architect** at the Open-Ended Synergy Initiative (OSEI)  
- **Principal Nano-Optimization Overlord** at Global Framework for Abstract Scalability (GFAS)  
- **Lead Paradigm Wrangler** at CorpCorp² (a subsidiary of CorpCorp Holdings, LLC)  

**Current Mission:**  
Leveraging Next.js-adjacent hypermodality to disrupt the internship-industrial complex via AI-driven desperation frameworks.

# Current Quests

- Escaping jobofobia and nailing that first interview (send help).  
- Mastering industrial confusion & inconvenience engineering (PhD in "why is this broken?").  
- Learning to spell with Grammarly, lol.  
- Surviving the React Civil War—Team Simplicity vs. Team Iceland’s cloud sales pitch.  
- Chasing rats (those cheese-munching gray dudes) to fix my circadian cycle. No more midnight scurries.  

# Hot Takes

- Next.js? Vibe-coding mind virus. Security flop had haters partying in Mom’s basement.  
- AI’s eating code jobs, but React devs are too busy beefing to notice. GG.  
- DeepSeek’s UI slaps, Grok’s got the best explanations, ChatGPT’s a sellout, and Gemini? Trash.  
- If “nonsense” trends on GitHub, I’m switching to Arch Linux and going full hermit.  

# Fun Facts

- I’d rebuild with **R(react).E(express).TA(tailwind).R(redis).D(deno)** stack if I started coding again. Deno’s my spirit animal.  
- Obsessed with cubic regression and verbose abstractions—because why make it simple?  
- Trump’s tariff game > Sun Tzu’s Art of War. Multi-polar world, baby.  
- My commit messages? Gen Z poetry: *force push and pray, yolo deploy, rats ate my code.*  

Check my repos for chaotic brilliance, or DM me for rat-trapping tips. Let’s build something stupidly awesome.
